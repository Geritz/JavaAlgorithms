# Polymorphism
In this example, we have three classes, a superclass and two subclasses.

Semi and Car both inherit from the Automobile super class, and can call on the superclass functions.

The OOP.java file is just a quick demonstration of this functionality.

It is assumed that all classes are part of the same package.
